         	<p>So, I have had a few stories about antennas and although I have been making some FT8 contacts with the little sprit on the back of the boat, it is not the best antenna. If you look at my boat there is a long metal wire almost going to the top of the mast. Some boats use that with the <a href="https://www.lijnenspecialist.nl/insulator-swage-stud-each-side">aid of insulators</a> to create an antenna. But these are quite expensive. In any case you&rsquo;d need an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_tuner">antenna tuner</a> to make the antenna work with your transmitter. However as I did some research, one boat owner didn&rsquo;t bother with the insulators and discovered that a modern antenna tuner can tune the complete rigging!
So when I got a discount on the <a href="http://www.cgantenna.be/product_cg3000.html">CG-3000 antenna tuner</a> at Wimo, I decided to jump on it and hopefully improve the antenna situation on the boat.</p>

         	<p>As part of my plan to make some of the radio amateur band more accessible to me on the boat I have bought an <a href="https://www.sdrplay.com/rspduo/">SDRPlay RSPDuo</a>. I receive a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code#Q-codes_as_adapted_for_use_in_amateur_radio">QRM</a> on the 40m band on my boat in the evening and given the fact that I can&rsquo;t move anywhere nor can I drastically change my antenna situation I&rsquo;m working on a plan using something called <a href="https://www.w8ji.com/polarization_and_diversity.htm">diversity radio</a>. But that I will discuss in another article once I get closer to achieving that goal.</p>

<p>First I wanted to use the fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6R5qAeQQug">SDRuno software</a> that at the moment only runs on Windows. As I have given up on my principles of using only Mac software a while ago, I&rsquo;d thought getting it to work with my copy of VMWare Fusion 10 should be a no-brainer. Well&hellip;</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>A MacBook Pro 2015 with 16GB RAM and a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 running macOS 10.14.6. So plenty of power to share with Windows.
I also have a Windows 10 Home licence (although its activation keeps complaining but I bought an official USB stick with Windows dammit!).
I decided to give Windows 4GB RAM and 4 virtual processors.</p>

<h3>VMWare Fusion 10</h3>

<p>The first thing we have to understand that if you sample 10MHz of radio spectrum at 14 bits, we are talking about a lot of data that needs to be transferred from the device to your Mac and then to Windows. At least 133MB/s of continuous data transfer over a USB bus! SDRUno uses a cool feature of USB to help with that, it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb4.shtml#Isochronous">i-synchronous transfers</a>. I now the Mac can handle this since I connected it to a DAC for hifi audio and that worked fine when I still had access to hifi in the dark days before the boat. But that&rsquo;s where it went wrong because USB support is not easy in a VM environment since VMWare announced full USB3 support for the latest version Fusion 12. So I noticed that I could switch to bulk transfer in SDRUno but that was not great. I noticed a less than stellar performance. SDRUno would complain that the USB device suddenly disappeared and multi-tasking between Mac and Windows caused this to happen frequently.</p>

<h3>VirtualBox 6.1</h3>

<p>Since I tried not to spend another amount of money to upgrade VMWare Fusion I tried VirtualBox. This was a terrible experience both the UI and the data transfer suffered from lots of lag and hick-ups as it only supported USB bulk transfer.</p>

<h3>VMWare Fusion 11</h3>

<p>On my Mac I still use macOS 10.14 since the later OS versions are taking more and more control away from you and a lot of ham radio software doesn&rsquo;t work properly. Thus I tried Fusion 11 as that is the latest supported release for my setup. I contacted VMware and I could purchase a licence for 12 and downgrade it to 11 if I have to.
So I tried it with the demo version. It did support i-synchronous transfers but again it was not stable enough. Lots of times SDRuno complained the USB device disappeared and whilst decoding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting">DAB</a> it would just crash.</p>

<h3>VMWare Fusion 12</h3>

<p>I managed to borrow an even more powerful MacBook Pro running macOS 15 and I put Fusion 12 on it. Tried SDRUno again and it worked. DAB decoding worked as well. So that looked promising. But when I went to do some Mac work whilst listening to a DAB transmission it would fail again. So I was running out of options bar one.</p>

<h3>Parallels Desktop</h3>

<p>For some reason I didn&rsquo;t consider <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels Desktop</a>. Looking at the price it seemed similar to a Fusion upgrade so that wouldn&rsquo;t stop me.
What I liked is that as soon as I started it it started downloading Windows and installed it for me. With Fusion and VirtualBox you have to do all of that manually. The other good thing is that it can pass the discrete GPU to Windows as well which SDRUno can use. So from the get-go it worked fine. Listening to DAB and doing all kinds of stuff on the Mac worked reliably. Sometimes you can hear drop-outs but it doesn&rsquo;t crash nor make the USB device disappear. The only issue is that if you Mac goes to sleep and wakes up again you&rsquo;ll use your USB device and have to restart SDRUno. It would be great it they could dynamically reconnect.
You can also use Coherence mode which allows you to mix Windows and Mac windows in the same session as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>So with this setup and I have listened many hours to my RSPDuo and it is an amazing piece of kit. I hope to write some more articles about my experiences with this radio and its software. I have lots of ideas and thanks to COVID lots of time to work on it as well.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests"></p>

<p>Today I took the afternoon off from work to test if I can receive some <a href="https://amsat-uk.org/2021/01/21/iss-sstv-145-800-fm-jan-28-29/">SSTV images from the ISS</a>. One of the alumni of the Moscow Aviation Institute is part of the Russian crew. They were running some experiments for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television">SSTV</a> transmission capability.</p>

<p>First I had to check whether it was possible for me to receive it given the <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov">passes the ISS is making over Ireland</a>. I&rsquo;m using some software on the iPhone for this: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/satellite-tracker-by-star-walk/id1248172706">Satellite Tracker by Star Walk</a>.</p>

<p>I did make a mistake because the original time slot of 1620-1740UTC was a bit too early, however there was a pass relatively close:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/b933ac5d61.png" alt="Low pass of ISS" title="IMG_4131.png" border="0" width="277" height="600" /></p>

<p>So I just switched on my Yaesu FT-857D with the ATAS-120A antenna on the back of the deck rack and hooked it to my laptop and lo-and-behold!</p>

<video width=640 height=360 controls autoplay>
  <source src="http://gonnado.it.s3.amazonaws.com/blog.annard.net/video/Sstv_From_ISS.mp4"  type="video/mp4" title="Receiving SST from ISS"/>
</video>

<p>With this the full image:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/a1ce857bbf.png" alt="SSTV image 7/12" title="29Jan2021-170319.PNG" border="0" width="600" height="465" /></p>

<p>I left the receiver running, suddenly I heard the second image pop up, then the signal dropped and reappeared again, must have been some interesting <a href="https://vu2nsb.com/radio-propagation/free-space-propagation/">propagation path on the 2m-band</a>.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/3d1589c309.png" alt="second image ISS location" title="IMG_4132.png" border="0" width="277" height="600" /></p>

<p>But I did get a more skewed image (which makes sense given the <a href="https://n1aae.com/visualizing-satellite-doppler-shift/">Doppler shift that must be more pronounced now as I didn&rsquo;t change the tuning frequency</a>):</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/0f51ddd178.png" alt="skewed image 8/12" title="29Jan2021-170729.PNG" border="0" width="600" height="465" /></p>

<p>But with some correction it came out improved:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/0ff2c46fb0.jpg" alt="Skew corrected" title="skew corrected.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="465" /></p>

<p>Note there were 12 images in total to receive but given the time I made available, I&rsquo;m happy I got one and a half!</p>

         	<p>Today I was listening to the 20m band and there was an Iraqi station <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/YI9WS">YI9WS</a> being gated by <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/I0IJ">I0IJ</a> and I couldn&rsquo;t hear the Iraqi station.

<p>You&rsquo;re not the only one! What&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p>I have been wanting to move away from WhatsApp for quite some time but unfortunately it is still taking first-mover advantage so people think that it&rsquo;s the only game in town. And thanks to the EU we did get a bit of leeway with the dirty &ldquo;grabbing them by their data&rdquo; attitude of Facebook.
However, they are going to try again and this time there is no opting out other than getting out, see <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp_terms_change/">this article in The Register</a>. So before the of the month <strong>I will get out</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course I would love to stay in touch with you and I wholly recommend <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> as a better <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">open-source</a> and properly <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/signal/">security vetted alternative</a>. Follow the EU Commission and even Elon Musk who are all recommending Signal. I hope to find you there!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As described in <a href="https://microblog.annard.net/2020/11/07/dmr-hotspot-on.html">previous postings</a> I had a nice little package for my <a href="https://microblog.annard.net/2020/12/05/programming-nextion-screen.html">DMR radio experiments</a>. I did notice however that there was a lot of noise when the unit was broadcasting on 144.950MHz that caused me issues with my FT-857D when I was working the local community on 145.575MHz. You can see a spectrum here when the MegaDV was broadcasting (thanks to Ana EI/EA7KMA for the loan of the <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/">SDR-RTL</a>):</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/d08064d2a5.png" alt="SDR spectrum image" title="Screenshot 2020-11-29 at 18.04.01.png" border="0" width="598" height="303" /></p>

<p>And in general the noise level on HF was also higher when I had the unit switched on. So I bought a <a href="https://www.ebay.ie/itm/264532846982">little aluminium enclosure from Germany</a>. I also discovered that the CPU temperature was always around 55ºC and wanted to reduce it a bit. After talking to Mike EI2DJ he was able to cut some pieces of aluminium together with some paste to transfer heat from an IC. (Thank you again Mike!)</p>

<p>Today I finally had some time to move the Pi into its new enclosure. First I drew the PCB on a piece of paper with the area on the bottom with one of the ICs that I wanted to cool down drawn in. The CPU is on top and needs a heatsink but the MegaDV board is right above it so that is a future project. This allowed me to find the optimum placement of the pieces of metal as shown below.</p>

<p>The first metal plate was easier to place since there was enough free space for any pins sticking out the PCB. A bit of research indicated that Loctite Superglue should be suitable to glue metal to metal. And I put the heat transfer compound in between:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/ca8d892640.jpg" alt="First metal plate" title="IMG_4103.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>The second metal place would be in contact with the IC. Placement here was somewhat more critical since there are a few SMD components around it that are almost the same height. I also glued this with lots of heat transfer compound:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/0a1552fc4f.jpg" alt="Second metal plate" title="IMG_4105.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>After making sure everything fits and the Raspberry Pi was still working(!), I put some of the compound on the IC:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/c96816c79e.jpg" alt="IC with heat transfer compound" title="IMG_4107.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>Then it was time to reassemble it:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/8d8e2698a2.jpg" alt="PCB in casing" title="IMG_4108.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>You can see there is good contact between the PCB and the impromptu heatsink:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/c01821381c.jpg" alt="Heatsink visible" title="IMG_4106.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>Now it was time to drill the hole for the external VHF/UHF antenna. I do have all the tools on board: vice, drill and Dremel. (I made a small mistake here because the top of the case had to be rotated 180º but it works.)</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/2a68436c49.jpg" alt="Top of case in vice" title="IMG_4109.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>Once the hole was large enough, the antenna was fitted. However the MegaDV board needed a washer to keep it in place on the GPIO bus otherwise it would get loose when you screw the antenna back in (it&rsquo;s the white-ish bit in the top left).</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/e567258b82.jpg" alt="Hole ready to be filled" title="IMG_4112.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s working again:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/763026526f.jpg" alt="Working Pi and radio" title="IMG_4110.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>It has been running for the last 6 hours and the CPU temperature hovers around 45º so that is 10º less compared to the old case. I do not notice it is transmitting at all on the FT-857D unless I tune to about 10 MHz of the transmission frequency. So all in all a great success! (Once I can borrow Ana&rsquo;s SDR-RTL again, I can see what the spectrum looks like now, to be continued).</p>

         	<p>So&hellip; water on a boat. Most of the time you don&rsquo;t want it but in one case you do: the water-tap in the galley. It had been dripping since mid-November and it was one of those jobs that should be easy but in the end are one of those never-ending stories.</p>

<p>When I noticed that <a href="https://microblog.annard.net/2020/10/03/we-need-to.html">the water pump</a> would make a funny noise from time to time, it turned out that the drip caused the pressure to drop and the pump would kick in slightly. Given the history of these pumps, I&rsquo;d rather not do funny things to them. So should be easy, get a washer, take tap apart, replace washer. It was very corroded and I couldn&rsquo;t open it with a vice. <a href="https://explodingkittens.gamepedia.com/Nope_card">Nope</a>.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s find some time to go to Homebase and find a tap I like there. It&rsquo;s a pretty long bicycle ride but it&rsquo;s essential as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I find a nice tap but when I come back to the boat it has a 26mm hose opening and not 21mm. I would need to enlarge the hole near the sink and get a adaptor from the existing hose. <a href="https://explodingkittens.gamepedia.com/Nope_card">Nope</a>.</p>

<p>OK, so maybe I should get a caravan water tap in that case. I don&rsquo;t like them, they look flimsy but given the COVID circumstances better a flimsy water tap than a dripping water tap. But when I got it by mail order 2 weeks later it was also not a good idea it turned out. I couldn&rsquo;t connect my existing hose on it without an adaptor. <a href="https://explodingkittens.gamepedia.com/Nope_card">Nope</a>.</p>

<p>Right at that point it was a beautiful Sunday morning and I was fed up. I took the fancy taps I bought (oh yes they come in pairs and I only need one) to Homebase and take my existing tap and see what can be done.</p>

<p>I found a friendly kitchen salesperson, explained my predicament and he found (almost) exactly the drippy water tap I had brought with me. In pairs. I could go to the surplus area out back to find one but it may have missing bits. I&rsquo;ll get the pair and fitted it in. Cleaned the old hose and washer inside. Connected it, turn on the tap. Water everywhere. Now that washer is leaking. Fortunately the washers I bought earlier worked even though the opening was a bit too small but now the pump needs to build more pressure and it can handle it. Case closed. Cross fingers.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;m doing a rope splicing course online through <a href="https://premiumropes.com/">Premium Ropes located in Amsterdam</a>. Absolutely brilliant. I had all the tools on board but was planning to get to know them. Now I do and there are a number of jobs I have to do over the winter to make things better!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what they have to say on it:</p>

<blockquote><em>Premium Ropes organizes workshops in Splicing Modern Ropes for yacht clubs all over the world. In two separate webinars we explain the various materials and rope constructions for modern ropes. We will also explain which rope is best to use for a specific application.
But this webinar is mainly about ‘Doing It Yourself’. You will learn how to splice ropes consisting of Dyneema® or Stirotex fibres, splice with double braided polyester lines and make soft shackles. Many practical examples are also shown on how to apply this to your own yacht. During the Webinar there are opportunities to ask questions.
At the end of the training you will have a better understanding of the materials of which ropes are made. You will grasp the basics of splicing and with the learned techniques be able to optimize your ship. Whether you are a cruiser or a professional regatta sailor: this is a workshop you don’t want to miss.</em></blockquote>

<p>And here you see my results:</p>

<p>I also used the provided SMA-JJ RG316 coaxial cables to connect the antennas to the analyser. I used the <pre>nanovna-saver</pre> software on my Mac connected to the USB port to control the analyser.</p>

         	<p><center><h1>Roasted quinces cake</h1></center></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p><em>Roasting the quinces</em>
<ul>
    <li>3 quinces, peeled, quartered and remove core</li>
    <li>250ml water</li>
    <li>250 g sugar</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 large piece of lemon peel (remove the white bit)</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>optional: 1 star anise</li>
</ul></p>

<p><em>Muffins</em>
<ul>
    <li>150 g softened butter</li>
    <li>150 g brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 table spoon spice mix: <a href="https://ohmydish.com/make-dutch-speculaaskruiden-spice-mix/">see this site for the recipe</a></li>
    <li>3 eggs at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 table spoons orange blossom water</li>
    <li>150 g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 roasted quince in pieces</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Preparations</strong></p>

<p><em>Roasting the quinces</em></p>

<p>Pre-heat the oven at 200ºC. Add all the ingredient in a Dutch oven o.s.s. Put it in the oven for an hour, covered with aluminium foil. If you want to turn the quince parts 1 or 2 times. No lower the temperature to 170ºC. Remove the foil and roast the quinces for another 45 minutes. They have to be completely soft when you stick something sharp in them. Remove the quince parts. You can cool down the liquid and use it as a syrup for mixing or to drizzle over the muffins. Leave one quince apart for the muffins and cut it in small pieces.</p>

<p><em>Muffins</em></p>

<p>Pre-heat the oven at 180ºC. Mix the soft butter with the brown sugar and spice mix until the butter is aerated. Then, one by one, add the eggs. Only add an egg until the mix has absorbed an egg completely. Finally, add the orange blossom water. Now spoon the flour and quince pieces into the mix. Fill the muffin shapes and put in the oven. You can also make a cake in a springform of ~22cm (which I prefer). The muffin cook time is about 15-20 minutes, a cake would be around 40 minutes. You can check by sticking something sharp in it and it should come out dry.
Let it cool on a roster. You can serve it with the syrup drizzled over it.</p>

<p>It was very good with a <a href="https://www.killahoraorchards.ie/product/rare-apple-ice-wine/">Killahora Rare Apple Ice Wine 2018</a></p>

         	<p>A <a href="https://microblog.annard.net/2020/08/27/dmr-hotspot-arrived.html">couple of months ago</a> I bought a DMR hotspot with the assumption that it was able to work on the VHF band (since I&rsquo;m not allowed to work on UHF on my boat). But it didn&rsquo;t do it! So, even though supposedly the MMDVM board would support it, it was minuscule SMD soldering so I gave up to fix it.</p>

<p>Luckily I was able to <a href="https://www.combitronics.nl/index.php?route=product/product&path=61&product_id=69">get a dual-band system</a> but it would not fit the case of the Raspberry Pi Zero. That computer was also rather underpowered and so I have upgraded to a Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+ at the same shop. It also has more full-size USB ports so I can connect it to other equipment much easier.</p>

<p>It is working fine:</p>

<p>And on a legal frequency:</p>

         	<p>Today I received my signed copy of the book that I helped edit and type-set: <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/474731780">Follow the Sun — how to rebel scientists solved Covid-19</a></em>.</p>

<p>“How do I happen to do something like that,” I hear you ask? Well, I&rsquo;m glad you asked!</p>

<p style="text-decoration:line-through;">A long, long time ago in a galaxy far away...</p>
<p>False start. But when I was much, much younger (but just as stupid as I am now) I was the editor-in-chief of a magazine of the computer club S.T.A.C.K. at the <a href="https://tue.nl">TU Eindhoven</a>. There was a porter working there who taught me a lot about the art of type-setting and I have always had a soft spot for doing this work. So when my dear friend <a href="https://melanieoreilly.com">Melanie O'Reilly</a> asked me if I could help her out with this project she took on (in my spare time), I gladly agreed. It was a bit more work than expected but the result made everyone involved very happy. Even the printer and publisher gave positive feedback!</p>

<p>This is the front cover I designed, based on a photo I took in Malta in 2009:</p>

         	<p>May I remind the dear reader that I had to <a href="https://annard.micro.blog/2020/03/22/replacing-water-pump.html">replace my fresh water pump back in March</a>? Well, about a week ago this new one gave up the ghost. It happened when I went to bed and I decided to sleep on it and try to fix it the next day. Well, I fixed it for about 15 minutes (not knowing exactly what I did other than fiddle with the water hoses and fill the water tank). And after I put everything away, it stopped working again. Looking at the manual that stated there are no user-serviceable parts inside, it must have been the pressure sensor. Fortunately I hadn&rsquo;t bought this online but through a local shop in Dun Laoghaire, <a href="http://solasmarine.net">Solas Marine</a>, I called Tom and a replacement would be ready in a few days.</p>

<p>Today I cycled to Dun Laoghaire to get the replacement. Nice cycle ride and it is much better to cycle there compared to before the pandemic! (I also cycled because I need the exercise as the swimming pool is still closed for my aquarobics classes).</p>

<p>I installed it and I have water again! Civilisation has returned (for as long as it lasts). The sound is also different from this one even though it&rsquo;s the same model, I hope that is a good sign&hellip;</p>

<p>And a photo, because that is what you were looking for?</p>

         	<p>As you may know I had to buy a new mainsail since the last one started tearing apart a year ago (it must have been at least 20 years old).</p>

<p>This has been a process with lots of stumble blocks (like most things with boats). The <a href="https://microblog.annard.net/2020/09/12/another-eventful-sail.html">full sail looks amazing</a> but reefing is a problem with the spray-hood up. The boom drops onto it and it is very difficult to tighten the reefpoint close to the boom so I had to lower the spray-hood. And in general when you have to reef the main sail, this is because it is windy and wet and you want some protection from the elements at the helm.</p>

<p>For the land lubbers out there: what does reefing the main sail mean? It is the process of reducing the the surface area of the main sail so the boat is not overpowered, it is the sailing equivalent of depressing the gas throttle but it is a bit elaborate and not as quick. <a href="http://www.nauticedsailingschool.com/learn-to-sail-series-how-to-reef-the-mainsail">Here is a nice article</a> that tells you how it is done on my boat. I have 3 reefing points so I can use the main sail in terrible weather.</p>

<p>Also the cars are attached to the main sail with some flimsy plastic bits and tiny screws that just don&rsquo;t work. The sailmaker promised to replace these:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/0220888a0d.jpg" alt="Broken" title="PHOTO-2020-09-12-16-24-43.jpg" border="0" width="337" height="600" /></p>

<p>Since I want the boat to be ready for single-handed sailing, I also bought a new sail cover with the lazyjack bag system which will look like this:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/dbedf694d2.png" alt="Bag lazy" title="bagbwlazy.png" border="0" width="447" height="600" /></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t go up the mast yet but I did fit the bag. There are a few issues but at the moment it looks quite nice:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/ec6d2debb1.jpg" alt="Lazybagged Oleander" title="IMG_3957.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>But the spray-hood is a problem again. Now I need to wrap a sail tie around the area to prevent chafing underway. I think I need to lower the spray-hood by cutting off a couple of centimetres of the hoop:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/765763c2e2.jpg" alt="Too close" title="IMG_3952.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>Incidentally, this is with the first reef properly set up!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Ever since March when I threw my old cushions covers out during the lockdown, I wanted to get new ones. During the same lockdown I&rsquo;d also ordered some waterproof LED lighting strips that never arrived (no surprise there as they had to come from China but for 10€ I figured it was worth a gamble, I lost). I did order new LED strips with a fancy kit to hook them up in different ways.</p>

<p>Now that we have a new partial lockdown in Dublin till at least October 10 and I have issues with my main sail (in a following post), I don&rsquo;t see this boat going anywhere. So I&rsquo;m &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in Dublin, at least I can use the WeWork office of my job and it is relatively cheap to live on the boat so I can safe lots of money so make good use of when we will be free next year (maybe, if we survive this one).</p>

<p>So today I bought some new mustard and black velvet cushion covers. Admire my showroom interior puny humans:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/a320985f7b.jpg" alt="Mustard and black velvet" title="IMG_3947.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>And with the LED &ldquo;mood&rdquo; lighting activated (it is finally becoming a bachelor pad):</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/8c1b59be95.jpg" alt="Same with mood lighting" title="IMG_3944.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>Finally I have some decent light in the navigation and galley areas:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/72f8684df8.jpg" alt="Kitchen alight" title="IMG_3945.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>The advantage is that it is USB powered so I can use it with both shore power and battery power! And when I change it to red, I have light for sailing at night that doesn&rsquo;t destroy your night vision. I also installed it in the V-berth so it is everywhere! Now I feel at home because these things were bothering me since I started my live aboard adventure in Scotland 3 years ago!</p>

         	<p>I saw a gentleman doing a paint job on another boat and since I knew the owners of that boat, I asked about the painter (John). We got to talk and he was willing to do the job, as long as I had the paint. Fortunately, before restarting my new job, I did buy new paint for the roof in case the weather was agreeing with it. I never got to do it and the last two days were perfect weather for it! And John had time to do it. I love it when a plan comes together.</p>

<p>Look at what a professional can do:</p>

         	<p>I like it dark when I sleep. Currently in the v-berth it is too light. Remember I did try to do <a href="https://annard.micro.blog/2020/03/07/fitting-a-blind.html">something about the roof hatch</a>. So I needed something better. You can get some very fancy <a href="http://ecat.plastimo.com/en/#page/294-295">Plastimo blackout blinds</a>. But I figured I can do something similar for a lot cheaper. I went to Eason to get an A2 portfolio binder for papers with black plastic covers. I cut the covers into the right size for my hatch and port holes. Then I cut some holes in for some suction cups and voilà:</p>

         	<p>Today we did another sail with Gil and Paddy. Look at the new main sail:</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a few problems with it which I hope work out with the sailmaker:</p>

<ul>
<li>When reefed, the boom is too low so I have to lower the spray hood. This wasn&rsquo;t the case with the old sail. And must be fixed because I&rsquo;d like to keep a dry cockpit and cabin entrance in bad weather!</li>
<li>The block for the main sheet on the boom is doing funny stuff because the boom can&rsquo;t freely rotate. I think this happens because the clew of the main sail is now attached to the boom and not the boom plate. I will change this (against the wishes of the sail maker but he should have given me a copy of my old sail).</li>
<li>I managed to pop the rivets off the boom vang inside the boom. But this was always a weak spot. I&rsquo;m going to design a bigger plate with 8 rivets so it will take a huge force to get that out!</li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can see the Poolbeg Light House on our way back into the river:</p>

         	<p>So when we got back from our sail yesterday, I plugged in the shore power because I had a full fridge and needed to keep it cool. But lo-and-behold: it didn&rsquo;t work. Again. WTF!</p>

<p>I bypass the new fuse system, and still doesn&rsquo;t work. By this time it&rsquo;s getting dark and I was hungry and frustrated. By now I have learned my lesson and I kept the fridge on the topped up battery and went back to the club for some dinner.</p>

<p>This morning I applied Occam&rsquo;s Razor to my problem and I come to the conclusion that it must be the plugs on the shore cable that cause the issue. Look what I found:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/20c719e455.jpg" alt="You eediot!" title="IMG_3925.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>No wonder nothing was working. Why did I approach the problem from a software engineering perspective where you know the problem is in the most complex system. But here it&rsquo;s mostly mechanical stuff and there was too much tension on the cable the way I had put it together back in Scotland 3 years ago. But look what vaseline on the copper does for you: it looks like new! So I checked the plugs on both ends, cleaned and greased them. Put the fuse system back in, and everything is fine. So, I didn&rsquo;t have to replace that system at all (but at least this one is IP67 rated and not IP55 so it will survive a flooded boat. 😏</p>

<p>Conclusion: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ9DTYKJ_PM">I am an eediot, man!</a></p>

With an inexperienced crew (and that includes myself because I don&rsquo;t know the new main-sail yet) I don&rsquo;t want to overpower the boat and get in potential trouble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one crew member lost the winch handle while tightening the main sail and as it floats we had to do a man overboard procedure! We did get alongside it but didn&rsquo;t have anything ready to scoop it up so I hope someone will be able to use it at some point in time.</p>

<p>It was a great sail and Ana even tried to confuse the local ham radio community by making a QSO on the Dublin repeater with her callsign EI/EA7KMA/MM 🤣</p>

<p>Thanks to my new <a href="https://www.avesmarine.com/blog/ais-explanation/">AIS class B transponder</a> I can actually see exactly what we have been doing via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/marinetraffic-ship-tracking/id563910324">MarineTracker iOS</a> application:</p>

</video>

<p>We made it to our home port safely with everybody intact. A nice shower to get everything wet when we were cleaning up the boat just added a bit of zest to the good experience! 🌈</p>

         	<p>Tuesday around 11am just before high tide we managed to motor away from the slip post and did a little victory tour on the Liffey. <strong>It’s alive!</strong></p>

<p>We put her back on the slip. I hook up the shore power and&hellip; nothing happens. I flip the Test button on the Safety RCD and&hellip; nothing happens. It was working Sunday.</p>

<p>So no fuzz, order a new one and 2 days and cycle trips to Radiocity Ltd in Rialto I have a new one that is IP67 and works.</p>

<p>I did have to work in the WeWork office because I really needed to get something done for work. But now I have moved back on the boat and we can go sailing again!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>No worries, it was by design!</p>

<p>About a month ago I couldn&rsquo;t move the boat even with the engine at full throttle. This was causing me a lot of anxiety and bad feelings towards Oleander. Fortunately two of my friends moved back home for a month and welcomed me to their place. So that&rsquo;s where I went. The boat and I needed separation and counselling.</p>

<p>The weather was not cooperating with two storms causing me to cancel 2 trips this month!</p>

<p>Finally today seemed like a good day to put the boat on the slip and check what&rsquo;s going on: does she still have a propellor? What does the bottom look like after having been at sea for almost 3 years?</p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t look too bad:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/8a546e7c0d.jpg" alt="Tide goes down" title="IMG_3893.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>However, when I got closer to the propellor:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/d929dce865.jpg" alt="Barnacles galore" title="IMG_3894.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>Too many barnacles, no wonder the propellor didn&rsquo;t work. After hosing down and scraping it off:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/39cdc48d89.jpg" alt="Kinda clean" title="62058573459__0C06B96A-AFB1-4B44-B752-340856FEF08B.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>I will do a better job later this coming winter I hope but now I have to put a bit of anti-foul paint on tomorrow very early for some protection against the nasty barnacles.</p>

<p>But overall she looks amazing after such a long time in the water:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/aaa72177d8.jpg" alt="Clean-ish" title="IMG_3902.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a fine vessel, lovely lines:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/bd2eaf4206.jpg" alt="A beaut" title="IMG_3905.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>Tomorrow she goes back to the berth, and this time I hope under her own power!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I received my BTech APRS-K2 cable to connect my computer/mobile device to the AnyTone D-878UV so I can use the APRS mode on 2m.</p>

<p>First I labelled two channels (see <a href="http://www.ei7ig.org/aprs.html">EI7IG&rsquo;s APRS Page</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li>&ldquo;APRS&rdquo; on 144.800MHz</li>
<li>&ldquo;APRS Voice Alert&rdquo; on the same frequency, but with a Squelch setting that is opened by a tone of 136.5Hz and it transmits that tone as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one I don&rsquo;t make part of a scan list, the other I have. Here you see the detailed settings for it:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/bc08cb8fc0.png" alt="APRS Settings" title="APRS Settings.png" border="0" width="547" height="600" /></p>

<p>And here the settings for the second one:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/5d07c4d164.png" alt="APRS Voice Alert Settings" title="APRS Voice Alert Settings.png" border="0" width="547" height="600" /></p>

<p>Great! Now that the radio was happy, I decided to enable the Vox setting and connect the radio to my iPhone where I run <a href="http://www.aprs.fi">aprs.fi</a> for iOS. Receiving worked great but transmitting seemed to fail? Following the instructions to the letter, I had enabled the VOX feature. After a lot of fiddling, I was going back to the AnyTone CPS&rsquo; Optional Settings and I noticed (by accident) that the VOX was only enabled for the internal microphone. You need to enable it for the external microphone only. That way you can still use it for handheld use:</p>

<p>Now, using my Baofeng UV-9R I could hear the transmission. Not sure if it went anywhere, at this time there is not a lot of activity happening. To be continued&hellip;</p>

         	<p>Thanks to COVID-19 and unemployment I have time to do things I have wanted to do for a long time!</p>

<p>Whilst I got the transceiver selected, shipped and installed, I managed to contact the Netherlands&rsquo; government telecommunications agency to send me my radio-amateur paperwork. Thanks to EU legislation my exam result from 1984 was valid for Ireland! My former housemate Anderson scanned it for me (because that is still my address, thanks Global!) and I managed to register it electronically with the Irish government&rsquo;s telecommunications agency. After 1 day(!) I got some questions about my location (being the boat) and then I got a message that payment was received. I went to the website and <strong>I had become EI4IQB</strong>!</p>

<p>In the meantime I did get my ham radio equipment (a discontinued model with broadcast FM included, see an earlier post). And now I could finally start transmitting again!</p>

<p>I got very emotional when I was listening to ham radio operator QSOs because it had been a long time since I was able to listen to these and I have great memories of those times&hellip; 😃</p>

         	<p>The antenna I ordered for my transceiver was made for cars and trucks. The reason I bought this one was that I&rsquo;d figured I could mount it on the rack at the back of the boat. So I designed a mounting plate and and thanks to a local sailor (thanks again Roger) with access to a laser cutter, it was created in no time whatsoever!</p>

         	<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an FM radio on board and it&rsquo;s lockdown, what happens if the zombie war starts and my mobile phone is not working? How do I know what to do? What may still work? Something must be done! Can I get a radio on the boat with the lockdown and the marina closed? Where do I let them deliver it? I was looking for multi-function shortwave receivers but then I got a better idea&hellip;</p>

<p>A long time ago, in a country far away, there was a nerd who found a safe space in the ham radio club of his secondary school. It had the call sign PI1GOE and it was an amazing place to be. The stuff we were able to do without adult supervision most school children can only dream off (like cycling to school on a Saturday morning at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning to meet a couple of other students so we could <a href="https://www.universalclass.com/articles/self-help/ham-radio-basics.htm">&ldquo;work&rdquo; the 80m and 40m bands</a> where the propagation was the best at that hour, no teacher in sight.)
Since we had no teacher with a radio-amateur licence I decided that I should get one (I was 15-16 years old). I got it and became <a href="http://www.redwaveradio.com/7_85c0ed5654e0658d_1.htm">PE1KOO</a>. When I left the Netherlands to work in the USA I left my licence by the wayside but always wanted to reactivate my licence. In the last 3 years I managed to find the necessary paperwork but life was far too busy to do something about it.</p>

<p>So I will get a shortwave transceiver and put it on the boat. That way I can also use it for email when sailing and lots of other uses! After a lot of research I found the radio I wanted and an antenna to match it. And the company was willing to ship it to me and ask the delivery company to call me when they arrive at the marina&hellip;</p>

<p>(There was a problem with the phone number but fortunately the general manager was in on the time of delivery):</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/89377bacbe.jpg" alt="A huge package!" title="60907715562__E27A7542-1654-449B-8035-2C7779F88B86.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>I unpacked it and rigged a temporary antenna:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/4bf5ac584d.jpg" alt="FT-857D" title="60909140111__E6CC0034-4941-44F2-AC6C-DF0B8F1FB381.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

         	<p>One of the things that have been annoying me madly ever since I bought the boat: water dripping inside. So I swore an oath to keep the boat dry whatever the cost! Today a new battle has started.
The area under the kitchen sink where I keep my cutlery would get wet. That is not fun. I made sure rain couldn&rsquo;t get in anymore, but water would still get in from the edge of the kitchen sink. Time to fix this properly so I removed the screws and ripped out the sink from the tiny bit of silicone that kept it &ldquo;dry.&rdquo;
The horror to the filth I discovered!

<p>And now put it back with black silicone (it was the only tube I had left on the boat: waste not, want not):</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/e7a6e44a69.jpg" alt="Black is beautiful" title="IMG_3727.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>This is a proper quantity of silicone to make sure it seals properly. After 1 day of drying, I cut it off and now my cutlery is dry! Score another one for me!</p>

<p>I have noticed that the hatch in the heads (that is toilet for you landlubbers) would stay up when I opened it. It used to do that but I guess it is being used more so I needed to do something. And suddenly I got an idea. Remember that you should <a href="https://annard.micro.blog/2020/03/26/dont-throw-away.html">never throw something away</a>?</p>

<p>I had a couple of pieces of wood lying around from the Dutch flag I had bought. One bit was particularly useful as it turns out:</p>

         	<p>Way, way, way back in 2008 when I sailed on Oleander for the first time in the Mediterranean, we had a problem. The NavTex unit didn&rsquo;t work even though the antenna was there. And we needed the weather reports in Italy and Spain. Being the only one with a smidgen of Italian, French and Spanish I was shanghaied to listen to the VHF at the designated times to write down these weather reports. This was not easy.
Moving forward people tell you that with your mobile you can get everything from the internet. But what if you don&rsquo;t have reception? Bring back the trusty NavTex unit please! So I&rsquo;d bought one in Scotland. But I never took the effort to install it because I had to replace the old antenna (which had broken off last winter in a storm) and it is a bit of work.</p>

<p>Feeling empowered with my new-found skills, I decided I was going to do it now! Here you can see it in action:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/08c1355a7c.jpg" alt="NavTex in use" title="60693668347__5900A9C3-F2FA-467E-8875-A4B740C3C2E5.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>I had to reduce the number of messages I received from all over Europe, such as Belgium, Spain, Germany. The Belgium one is ordering no recreational boat traffic is allowed in Belgian waters because of COVID-19. However, I do get the Irish Sea weather reports now. (And the unit only uses 20mA, so it is running all the time!)</p>

         	<p>Remember the old water pump hanging by one screw? There was a rubber bit that was supposed to dampen the sound of the pump (it doesn&rsquo;t really work, same with the new one). But I saved it because it might come in handy. Especially when you want to put up a shaving mirror temporarily over the sink!</p>

         	<p>The electric water pump broke down. Not a good thing when you live on a boat and have no manual backup. So I quickly had to replace it with a new one before the lockdown really prevents anything from happening. This is what we have:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/3002578f40.jpg" alt="old electric waterpump" title="IMG_3698.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="450" /></p>

<p>While I was picking up my serviced life-jackets at Solas Marine in Dun Laoghaire, there happened to be a pump available. Maybe a bit too powerful for what I need, but waste not want not.
As you can see in the photo above the pump was literally hanging by one screw, this was rather unacceptable to me. Having some hardwood available from a 2m long piece I made a new rack so I could properly put it up by all 4 screws:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/024f7f4fc2.jpg" alt="pump removed" title="60656404271__F414CB29-19E1-4546-92C1-E688FC82994D.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/aa65314833.jpg" alt="new pump installed" title="IMG_3704.jpeg" border="0" width="450" height="600" /></p>

<p>This was a type of pump that didn&rsquo;t need to be primed, i.e. you don&rsquo;t have to fiddle filling it with water before it can pump from the tank. But it didn&rsquo;t pump well, it had lots of air in it so when you ran the tap the water spat everywhere. The trick is to make sure that the clamps on any hose are <strong>really</strong> tight. Now it works like a charm!</p>

         	<p>In order to keep me somewhat warmer at night and somewhat warmer during the day, it would be good to put a divider in the cabin between the place I normally stay and the v-berth. So I bought a whopping big towel, hammered some rings in it and had the local seamstress shorten it. And now I have a bit more comfort!

         	<p>A long time ago in France I bought this stand for my Dremel and I was wondering whether I should leave it on the boat since I never had to use it. Today I&rsquo;ve proven that I am a visionary since I really needed it to drill some small holes in aluminium.</p>

<p>I was able to set up some kind of blind for my top hatch where I&rsquo;m sleeping. It&rsquo;s not a great way to make a blacked-out v-berth, but it helps a bit.</p>

         	<p>My engine had issues again with the oil level rising. For the longest time I couldn&rsquo;t find a mechanic so I left the boat for what it was. Other than a bit of varnishing in May nothing much had been done. Very, very sad. But sometimes you just need to walk away to maintain your sanity.</p>

<p>However, through some other sailors in the marina I heard of a reliable mechanical engineer that actually showed up to do work on your boat (what a difference with the eegit in Scotland)!</p>

<p>He discovered that the lift pump needed to be services and the glow plug needed replacement.</p>

<p>Now I can go sail again (at the end of the season):</p>

         	<p>On the mast there is a funny bit of aluminium that prevents the sail guides from dropping out of the rails. Since the proper screw to keep it in are missing I had to jury-rig it a bit. Since I prefer not to lose the original I went out on a limb and decided to use a 3D printer shop to copy the piece. Since it is not load-bearing I&rsquo;d thought that plastic could do the job. It works great!</p>

<p>(Addendum in July 2020: with the new sail and its guides, the copy is not good enough and the guides can flip out under stress such as when dropping the sail. The original had to go back in. Now I have to modify the copies for a better fit.)</p>

         	<p>Back in Scotland the engine panel in the cockpit was replaced. But the eegit who dunnit didn&rsquo;t give me the old panel with the fuel gauge back. The new panel lacked a fuel gauge. It&rsquo;s quite handy to know how much fuel is left if the fuel is stored in a metal box above the keel with no visibility as to its contents.</p>

<p>So I set to replace it. After much work, many extra parts and new tools I got it installed. But it doesn&rsquo;t work. I guess because the fuel sensor is American and the gauge European or vice-versa. They are not compatible. <strong>SIGH</strong></p>

<p>It looks good though:</p>

         	<p>Red red red, I only see red!</p>

<p>What is this exciting installment about? Definitely not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjzRbgxZXz8">&ldquo;Fun with flags&rdquo; by Dr. Sheldon Cooper</a>! [We don&rsquo;t mind if you take some time to watch that video, it is rather funny. — ed.]
<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome back to my new and bladder-bursting episode of &ldquo;Red flag&rdquo;. Now what is this all about? Let me elucidate you! [Btw. moronic Australian English testers: that one was for you! — ed.]</p>

<p>Oleander was normally found on a mooring before I rescued her from certain death. [Not that she repaid him in kindness. — ed.] Therefore when it is windy and raining, water will not get through the air gaps of the companionway&rsquo;s washboards, since she&rsquo;d turn bow into the wind. However, in a marina where the boat can&rsquo;t turn with the wind, I noticed that Scottish horizontal rain does get in and moreover can flood through the washboards and drip into the area underneath the sink where I store my cutlery. I have found the cutlery enjoying swimming lessons in these cases. And it is a pain to clean and dry everything. Also the wind can really get cold inside so something needed to be done.</p>

<p>I ordered up some canvas and turnbutton eyelets+washers to make a &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; that would match my sprayhood and would be fit for purpose to protect the interior of the boat in a marina. With the aid of Dorothy and Dave (where Dorothy did the sewing since I was afraid to break the sewing machine and did in fact manage to break a needle, Dave provided the pine wood and advice on how to hammer the eyelets+washers) I managed to make something that worked. [Although you did also manage to make a mistake in your measurements which meant that you had to use a bungie-cord to make things work as suggested by Dorothy since you didn&rsquo;t have enough space to screw in turnbuttons. — ed.]</p>

<p>Anyway, this is what it looks like:<br/>
<img src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/a01ed691a0.jpg" alt="red flag" /></p>

<p>It is easy to undo, and you could even use it when <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/running-with-the-wind-lyrics-dave-dudley.html">running with the wind</a> to prevent the wind blowing into the cabin. Or to shield the sun from shining in, or a million other uses!</p>

<p>Also, even though it was a cold but beautifully sunny day, look what the night had brought:</p>

<p><img src="https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/1cb60c6379.jpg" alt="snow on hill tops" /></p>

<p>And doesn&rsquo;t she look pretty despite being an absolute pain at the moment?</p>
