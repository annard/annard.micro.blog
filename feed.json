I used rg-8x coax as a mousing line on the marina to get it all in:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/1dc82c562d.jpg\" alt=\"laying out cables on the berths\" title=\"IMG_4352.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" />\n\nSoldering an eye on one end with a bit of heat shrink to protect it from moisture:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/cb46f96e6d.jpg\" alt=\"soldering an eye on one end\" title=\"IMG_4353.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nAnd finally stuffing the open end of the garden hose with CT1:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/c750481dc6.jpg\" alt=\"No water will get in\" title=\"IMG_4355.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" />\n\nThat should make sure no water is coming into the hose! This was a good point to stop for the day. Tomorrow part 2 when we actually lay the cable.\n",

But that I will discuss in another article once I get closer to achieving that goal.</p>\n\n<p>First I wanted to use the fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6R5qAeQQug\">SDRuno software</a> that at the moment only runs on Windows. As I have given up on my principles of using only Mac software a while ago, I&rsquo;d thought getting it to work with my copy of VMWare Fusion 10 should be a no-brainer. Well&hellip;</p>\n\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\n\n<p>A MacBook Pro 2015 with 16GB RAM and a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 running macOS 10.14.6. So plenty of power to share with Windows.\nI also have a Windows 10 Home licence (although its activation keeps complaining but I bought an official USB stick with Windows dammit!).\nI decided to give Windows 4GB RAM and 4 virtual processors.</p>\n\n<h3>VMWare Fusion 10</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing we have to understand that if you sample 10MHz of radio spectrum at 14 bits, we are talking about a lot of data that needs to be transferred from the device to your Mac and then to Windows. At least 133MB/s of continuous data transfer over a USB bus! SDRUno uses a cool feature of USB to help with that, it&rsquo;s called <a href=\"https://beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb4.shtml#Isochronous\">i-synchronous transfers</a>. I now the Mac can handle this since I connected it to a DAC for hifi audio and that worked fine when I still had access to hifi in the dark days before the boat. But that&rsquo;s where it went wrong because USB support is not easy in a VM environment since VMWare announced full USB3 support for the latest version Fusion 12. So I noticed that I could switch to bulk transfer in SDRUno but that was not great. I noticed a less than stellar performance. SDRUno would complain that the USB device suddenly disappeared and multi-tasking between Mac and Windows caused this to happen frequently.</p>\n\n<h3>VirtualBox 6.1</h3>\n\n<p>Since I tried not to spend another amount of money to upgrade VMWare Fusion I tried VirtualBox. This was a terrible experience both the UI and the data transfer suffered from lots of lag and hick-ups as it only supported USB bulk transfer.</p>\n\n<h3>VMWare Fusion 11</h3>\n\n<p>On my Mac I still use macOS 10.14 since the later OS versions are taking more and more control away from you and a lot of ham radio software doesn&rsquo;t work properly. Thus I tried Fusion 11 as that is the latest supported release for my setup. I contacted VMware and I could purchase a licence for 12 and downgrade it to 11 if I have to.\nSo I tried it with the demo version. It did support i-synchronous transfers but again it was not stable enough. Lots of times SDRuno complained the USB device disappeared and whilst decoding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Broadcasting\">DAB</a> it would just crash.</p>\n\n<h3>VMWare Fusion 12</h3>\n\n<p>I managed to borrow an even more powerful MacBook Pro running macOS 15 and I put Fusion 12 on it. Tried SDRUno again and it worked. DAB decoding worked as well. So that looked promising. But when I went to do some Mac work whilst listening to a DAB transmission it would fail again. So I was running out of options bar one.</p>\n\n<h3>Parallels Desktop</h3>\n\n<p>For some reason I didn&rsquo;t consider <a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/\">Parallels Desktop</a>. Looking at the price it seemed similar to a Fusion upgrade so that wouldn&rsquo;t stop me.\nWhat I liked is that as soon as I started it it started downloading Windows and installed it for me. With Fusion and VirtualBox you have to do all of that manually. The other good thing is that it can pass the discrete GPU to Windows as well which SDRUno can use. So from the get-go it worked fine. Listening to DAB and doing all kinds of stuff on the Mac worked reliably. Sometimes you can hear drop-outs but it doesn&rsquo;t crash nor make the USB device disappear. The only issue is that if you Mac goes to sleep and wakes up again you&rsquo;ll use your USB device and have to restart SDRUno. It would be great it they could dynamically reconnect.\nYou can also use Coherence mode which allows you to mix Windows and Mac windows in the same session as shown in the screenshot below.</p>\n\n<p>So with this setup and I have listened many hours to my RSPDuo and it is an amazing piece of kit. I hope to write some more articles about my experiences with this radio and its software. I have lots of ideas and thanks to COVID lots of time to work on it as well.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/eb14dc5735.png\" alt=\"SDRUno on Mac\" title=\"SDRUno on Mac.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" /></p>\n",

So before the of the month <strong>I will get out</strong>.\n\nOf course I would love to stay in touch with you and I wholly recommend <a href=\"https://signal.org\">Signal</a> as a better <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp\">open-source</a> and properly <a href=\"https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/signal/\">security vetted alternative</a>. Follow the EU Commission and even Elon Musk who are all recommending Signal. I hope to find you there!\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347309781564813312\">Check out this Tweet</a> to see how easy it is to switch your group from WhatsApp to Signal.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As described in <a href=\"https://microblog.annard.net/2020/11/07/dmr-hotspot-on.html\">previous postings</a> I had a nice little package for my <a href=\"https://microblog.annard.net/2020/12/05/programming-nextion-screen.html\">DMR radio experiments</a>. I did notice however that there was a lot of noise when the unit was broadcasting on 144.950MHz that caused me issues with my FT-857D when I was working the local community on 145.575MHz. You can see a spectrum here when the MegaDV was broadcasting (thanks to Ana EI/EA7KMA for the loan of the <a href=\"https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/\">SDR-RTL</a>):</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/d08064d2a5.png\" alt=\"SDR spectrum image\" title=\"Screenshot 2020-11-29 at 18.04.01.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"303\" /></p>\n\n<p>And in general the noise level on HF was also higher when I had the unit switched on. So I bought a <a href=\"https://www.ebay.ie/itm/264532846982\">little aluminium enclosure from Germany</a>. I also discovered that the CPU temperature was always around 55ºC and wanted to reduce it a bit. After talking to Mike EI2DJ he was able to cut some pieces of aluminium together with some paste to transfer heat from an IC. (Thank you again Mike!)</p>\n\n<p>Today I finally had some time to move the Pi into its new enclosure. First I drew the PCB on a piece of paper with the area on the bottom with one of the ICs that I wanted to cool down drawn in. The CPU is on top and needs a heatsink but the MegaDV board is right above it so that is a future project. This allowed me to find the optimum placement of the pieces of metal as shown below.</p>\n\n<p>The first metal plate was easier to place since there was enough free space for any pins sticking out the PCB. A bit of research indicated that Loctite Superglue should be suitable to glue metal to metal. And I put the heat transfer compound in between:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/ca8d892640.jpg\" alt=\"First metal plate\" title=\"IMG_4103.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>The second metal place would be in contact with the IC. Placement here was somewhat more critical since there are a few SMD components around it that are almost the same height. I also glued this with lots of heat transfer compound:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/0a1552fc4f.jpg\" alt=\"Second metal plate\" title=\"IMG_4105.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>After making sure everything fits and the Raspberry Pi was still working(!), I put some of the compound on the IC:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/c96816c79e.jpg\" alt=\"IC with heat transfer compound\" title=\"IMG_4107.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then it was time to reassemble it:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/8d8e2698a2.jpg\" alt=\"PCB in casing\" title=\"IMG_4108.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>You can see there is good contact between the PCB and the impromptu heatsink:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/c01821381c.jpg\" alt=\"Heatsink visible\" title=\"IMG_4106.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now it was time to drill the hole for the external VHF/UHF antenna. I do have all the tools on board: vice, drill and Dremel. (I made a small mistake here because the top of the case had to be rotated 180º but it works.)</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2021/2a68436c49.jpg\" alt=\"Top of case in vice\" title=\"IMG_4109.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n<p>Once the hole was large enough, the antenna was fitted.

Whether you are a cruiser or a professional regatta sailor: this is a workshop you don’t want to miss.</em></blockquote>\n\nAnd here you see my results:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/c243a523da.jpg\" alt=\"PHOTO 2020 12 10 18 51 25\" title=\"PHOTO-2020-12-10-18-51-25.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"338\" height=\"600\" /><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/3a79fe5bd0.jpg\" alt=\"PHOTO 2020 12 10 19 34 01\" title=\"PHOTO-2020-12-10-19-34-01.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" /><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/7191ac6009.jpg\" alt=\"PHOTO 2020 12 10 19 42 28\" title=\"PHOTO-2020-12-10-19-42-28.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"338\" height=\"600\" /><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://microblog.annard.net/uploads/2020/983d45a90f.jpg\" alt=\"PHOTO 2020 12 10 19 55 02\" title=\"PHOTO-2020-12-10-19-55-02.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"338\" height=\"600\" />\n",

I was looking for multi-function shortwave receivers but then I got a better idea&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>A long time ago, in a country far away, there was a nerd who found a safe space in the ham radio club of his secondary school. It had the call sign PI1GOE and it was an amazing place to be. The stuff we were able to do without adult supervision most school children can only dream off (like cycling to school on a Saturday morning at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning to meet a couple of other students so we could <a href=\"https://www.universalclass.com/articles/self-help/ham-radio-basics.htm\">&ldquo;work&rdquo; the 80m and 40m bands</a> where the propagation was the best at that hour, no teacher in sight.)\nSince we had no teacher with a radio-amateur licence I decided that I should get one (I was 15-16 years old). I got it and became <a href=\"http://www.redwaveradio.com/7_85c0ed5654e0658d_1.htm\">PE1KOO</a>. When I left the Netherlands to work in the USA I left my licence by the wayside but always wanted to reactivate my licence. In the last 3 years I managed to find the necessary paperwork but life was far too busy to do something about it.</p>\n\n<p>So I will get a shortwave transceiver and put it on the boat. That way I can also use it for email when sailing and lots of other uses! After a lot of research I found the radio I wanted and an antenna to match it.

I was looking for multi-function shortwave receivers but then I got a better idea...\n\nA long time ago, in a country far away, there was a nerd who found a safe space in the ham radio club of his secondary school. It had the call sign PI1GOE and it was an amazing place to be. The stuff we were able to do without adult supervision most school children can only dream off (like cycling to school on a Saturday morning at 3 o'clock in the morning to meet a couple of other students so we could <a href=\"https://www.universalclass.com/articles/self-help/ham-radio-basics.htm\">\"work\" the 80m and 40m bands</a> where the propagation was the best at that hour, no teacher in sight.)\nSince we had no teacher with a radio-amateur licence I decided that I should get one (I was 15-16 years old). I got it and became <a href=\"http://www.redwaveradio.com/7_85c0ed5654e0658d_1.htm\">PE1KOO</a>. When I left the Netherlands to work in the USA I left my licence by the wayside but always wanted to reactivate my licence. In the last 3 years I managed to find the necessary paperwork but life was far too busy to do something about it.\n\nSo I will get a shortwave transceiver and put it on the boat. That way I can also use it for email when sailing and lots of other uses! After a lot of research I found the radio I wanted and an antenna to match it. And the company was willing to ship it to me and ask the delivery company to call me when they arrive at the marina...\n\n(There was a problem with the phone number but fortunately the general manager was in on the time of delivery):\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/89377bacbe.jpg\" alt=\"A huge package!\" title=\"60907715562__E27A7542-1654-449B-8035-2C7779F88B86.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nI unpacked it and rigged a temporary antenna:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://annard.micro.blog/uploads/2020/4bf5ac584d.jpg\" alt=\"FT-857D\" title=\"60909140111__E6CC0034-4941-44F2-AC6C-DF0B8F1FB381.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nIt's great! Almost back in business...\n",
